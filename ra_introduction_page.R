<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>Immune-regulatory mechanisms of drug-free remission in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are unknown.
We hypothesised that synovial tissue macrophages (STM), which persist in remission, contribute
to joint homeostasis. We used single-cell transcriptomics to profile 32000 STMs and identified
phenotypic changes in patients with early/active RA, treatment-refractory/active RA and RA in
sustained remission. Each clinical state was characterised by different frequencies of 9 discrete
phenotypic clusters within 4 distinct STM subpopulations with diverse homeostatic, regulatory and
inflammatory functions. This cellular atlas combined with deep-phenotypic, spatial and functional
analyses of synovial biopsy FACS-sorted STMs revealed two STM subpopulations
(MerTK<sup>pos</sup>/TREM2<sup>high</sup> and MerTK<sup>pos</sup>/LYVE1<sup>pos</sup>) with unique remission transcriptomic signatures
enriched in negative-regulators of inflammation. These STMs were potent producers of
inflammation-resolving lipid mediators and induced the repair response of synovial fibroblasts <i>in
vitro</i>. A low proportion of MerTK<sup>pos</sup> STMs in remission was predictive of flare after treatment
cessation. Therapeutic fostering of MerTK<sup>pos</sup> STM-subpopulations could therefore be a successful
strategy for RA treatment.</p>
